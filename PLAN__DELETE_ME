SECTION 1 -- intro to buildsystems
=========

* Talk about compiling by hand small programs, but quickly becomes unweildy with more files/code -- forget commands, ordering, options, etcetera


* Talk about making cross-platform support easy with buildsystems


* Talk about easily altering our builds (using options) -- like optimisations or optional extras, etcetera


* Talk about the possibility of extending buildsystems to do testing/deployment


* General intro to the various buildsystems out there, and their relative strengths -- this course will focus on CMake


SECTION 2 -- intro to CMake
=========

* A very general introduction to CMake

* A very simple CMake build compared to manual commands


SECTION 3 -- customising builds
=========

* Build flags

* Compiler toolsets

* optional extras

* Debug and release builds

* Compiling binaries and libraries


SECTION 4 -- project structure
=========

* Complicated source trees

* Recursive CMake

* In-cource and out-of-source builds





SECTION ???
===========

* A real-life example

* Testing with CTest
